Returns the manufacturer policy for Reverse Logistic Business (Pharmacy Returns)

On the Reverse Logistic Industry you have hundreds of manufacturers with their respective policies, making very dificult to remember all the different policies. That is why I decide to create a program to help companies hire new employees with almost no training cost because the new employee only needs to scan the product (bar code) and the programm will show the especific manufacturer policy based on the UPC/NDC.
